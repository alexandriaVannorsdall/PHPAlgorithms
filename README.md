# Algorithms

This repository contains the code for the algorithms that we worked on as pseudo code. The challenge now is to convert
your pseudo code into real code!

## Scenario Scripts

To get you started, this repository contains a script for each of the scenarios in the `scripts` folder. So you do not
need to worry about how to get variables into the scripts, the initial starting script has taken care of this for you.
Each script has a docblock at the top telling you how to call it from the command line.

The file names for each of the scenarios are as follows:

1. Find the average of 3 numbers: `average.php`
2. Out of two numbers, determine which is bigger: `compare_two_numbers.php`
3. Determine whether a UK phone number is a mobile number: `is_mobile.php`
4. Given a list of numbers, find the largest number in the list: `max.php`
5. Given a list of numbers, sort the list into ascending order: `sort_numbers.php`
6. Generate a random password: `random_password.php`

You can work on these in any order you like. However, you **must** create a branch for each one, and work only on that
script in that branch. That means we can do PRs for each individual script, rather than mixing multiple scripts into
one PR.
